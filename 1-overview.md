# Overview


My goal for this application is to develop a practical, functional, and interactive app that tracks, notifies, and detects patterns in spending habits to better manage/improve the ability to save money. The app would have a login and user input for income sources and expenses (transactions). Then, the user will be able to set their saving goal and see a summary of expenses separated by category and percentages.

This app would incentivize long-term user engagement. Therefore, it would also offer customization and personalization options such as light or dark mode, and allow users to tailor it to their specific financial situation (by logging bill amounts and utilities). 

In addition, it would have a home page with a quick explanation of how to use the application for better UI experience and a menu directing to the multiple functionalities such as the input for transactions, their profile, a News feature with the latest business news, and a graph with the fluctuating values of income and expenses. Finally, the application would be targeted to university students to incentivize the development of healthy spending habits, with different specific saving goal settings, so the user can define their savings amounts.
