My goal for this application is to develop a practical, functional, and interactive app that tracks, notifies, and detects patterns in spending habits to better manage/improve the ability to save money and better invest. The app would have a login, and user input for income sources and expenses. Then, set their budget, see a summary of expenses so it's better to allocate where the spending is, and set goals.  

This app would incentivize long-term user engagement as it is an ongoing process. Therefore, the app can also offer customization and personalization options, allowing users to tailor it to their specific financial situation and needs. In addition to that, helping individuals manage their finances more effectively can have a positive social impact by promoting financial literacy, reducing financial stress, and empowering users to achieve their financial goals. 

Contributing to users' financial well-being presents an opportunity to address a pressing need, generate revenue, and make a positive impact on individuals' financial lives. Therefore, it would be useful to students and young professionals specifically, as they have to manage student loans, rent, and others. Also, taking into account that these are the individuals who are starting their careers and managing their finances independently for the first time, can benefit from a budget manager app to develop healthy spending habits.
