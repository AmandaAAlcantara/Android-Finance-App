**Mobile Development 2023/24 Portfolio**
# Overview

Student ID: `22083120`

My goal for this application is to develop a practical, functional, and interactive app that tracks, notifies, and detects patterns in spending habits to better manage/improve the ability to save money and better invest. The app would have a login and user input for income sources and expenses (transactions). Then, the user will be able to set their saving goal and see a summary of expenses separated by category and percentages.

This app would incentivize long-term user engagement. Therefore, it would also offer customization and personalization options such as light or dark mode, and allow users to tailor it to their specific financial situation (by logging bill amounts and utilities). 

In addition, it would have a home page with a quick explanation of how to use the application for better UI experience and a menu directing to the multiple functionalities such as the input for transactions, their profile, a News feature with the latest business news, and a graph with the fluctuating values of income and expenses. Finally, the application would be targeted to university students to incentivize the development of healthy spending habits, with different specific saving goal settings so the user can define their specific savings amounts.

Comments from Sandy:

This is a good start – you have the outlines of a target group and core functionality. Here are some suggestions for things to think about as you iterate on this idea:

1. I think this might benefit from a little scaling back of the motivation, and 'spending' those words on giving the reader a clearer idea of *how* the app will achieve its goals for users. Looking after money and understanding spending are clearly important things, but I think you spend a bit too long describing them. And then for the app, we only get a high level description of the budgeting features of the app.

2. You don't need to describe in precise detail every function of the app, but I would like to get a stronger feeling from the introduction of what the app will actually do – I should be able to anticipate what is going to come up on the screen after reading your introduction. You've started to do this, but it's quite high level. What kind of summary? Will there be charts? Will goal setting be a list , or do you have a more specific interaction in mind for doing this (that perhaps ties together recorded transactions)?

3. On a related note, you will need to make sure that there is room in the app to have decent coverage of different features of the Android API. This of course does not mean crowbarring features in for the sake of it, but you will need to give yourself the chance to think about how to get this coverage. It doesn't need to go into the overview –there are other chances to do it– but keep thinking about which features you could include that would be useful and demonstrate your skills (and perhaps some independent scholarship).

. Make sure that you are within the word limits. You're about 10% over at the moment. It might seem that we are being unnecessarily rigid, but the purpose of the low word counts for the portfolio components is to get you thinking in a really concise way about what it is 'in' and what is 'out'. We need to keep this fair, so we're going to be looking carefully at submission lengths for the final submissions.

I hope this is useful – do give me a shout if you have any queries.
