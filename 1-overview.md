**Mobile Development 2023/24 Portfolio**
# Overview

Student ID: `22083120`

My goal for this application is to develop a practical, functional, and interactive app that tracks, notifies, and detects patterns in spending habits to better manage/improve the ability to save money and better invest. The app would have a login, and user input for income sources and expenses. Then, set their budget, see a summary of expenses so it's better to allocate where the spending is, and set goals.  

This app would incentivize long-term user engagement as it is an ongoing process. Therefore, the app can also offer customization and personalization options, allowing users to tailor it to their specific financial situation and needs. In addition to that, helping individuals manage their finances more effectively can have a positive social impact by promoting financial literacy, reducing financial stress, and empowering users to achieve their financial goals. 

Contributing to users' financial well-being presents an opportunity to address a pressing need, generate revenue, and make a positive impact on individuals' financial lives. Therefore, it would be useful to students and young professionals specifically, as they have to manage student loans, rent, and others. Also, taking into account that these are the individuals who are starting their careers and managing their finances independently for the first time, can benefit from a budget manager app to develop healthy spending habits.

Comments from Sandy:

This is a good start – you have the outlines of a target group and core functionality. Here are some suggestions for things to think about as you iterate on this idea:

1. I think this might benefit from a little scaling back of the motivation, and 'spending' those words on giving the reader a clearer idea of *how* the app will achieve its goals for users. Looking after money and understanding spending are clearly important things, but I think you spend a bit too long describing them. And then for the app, we only get a high level description of the budgeting features of the app.

2. You don't need to describe in precise detail every function of the app, but I would like to get a stronger feeling from the introduction of what the app will actually do – I should be able to anticipate what is going to come up on the screen after reading your introduction. You've started to do this, but it's quite high level. What kind of summary? Will there be charts? Will goal setting be a list , or do you have a more specific interaction in mind for doing this (that perhaps ties together recorded transactions)?

3. On a related note, you will need to make sure that there is room in the app to have decent coverage of different features of the Android API. This of course does not mean crowbarring features in for the sake of it, but you will need to give yourself the chance to think about how to get this coverage. It doesn't need to go into the overview –there are other chances to do it– but keep thinking about which features you could include that would be useful and demonstrate your skills (and perhaps some independent scholarship).

. Make sure that you are within the word limits. You're about 10% over at the moment. It might seem that we are being unnecessarily rigid, but the purpose of the low word counts for the portfolio components is to get you thinking in a really concise way about what it is 'in' and what is 'out'. We need to keep this fair, so we're going to be looking carefully at submission lengths for the final submissions.

I hope this is useful – do give me a shout if you have any queries.
