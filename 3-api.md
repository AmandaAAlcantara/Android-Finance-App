Focusing on the transaction functionality of my app, where the user can add income and expenses. I chose to use ConstraintLayoutÂ for the activity_add_transaction XMl from the start, as I knew the different input options would grow as I developed this feature, and ensuring the UI would be adaptable was a priority - the new user needs to input information (form format). To expand, ConstraintLayout offers flexible and efficient positioning of UI elements, specifically allowing them to be aligned and distributed relative to each other and the parent. Therefore, making it easier to create the layouts for the different TextInput,  improving the performance and maintainability of the UI for different size phones. Despite the possible use of LinearLayout or RelativeLayout, the ConstraintLayout was the optimal choice considering the 5 elements that need to be positioned, the use was not over-engineered.

In addition, View API  in the TransactionAdapter class played a crucial role in delivering the list of transactions when a new one was created, ensuring consistency and compatibility with the RecyclerView framework. Therefore, the use of view in this context allows for straightforward manipulation within RecyclerView items, facilitating tasks such as view initialization, interaction handling, and layout inflation (as I had to add new transaction items and be able to edit them as well). More specifically, the TransactionHolder class is a ViewHolder for RecyclerView items responsible for holding references to views within each transaction layout. Therefore, the choice to use View as the parameter type for the ViewHolder constructor is correct since it represents the root view of each item. Moreover, inside the ViewHolder constructor (TransactionHolder), the views TextViews (label and amount) are initialized using findViewById. Since these views are part of the layout inflated for each item, it's logical to use View as the parameter type to access and manipulate these specific views.
